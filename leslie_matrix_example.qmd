## Leslie Matrix Example 

model population changes using the same example we did in lecture. 

```{r}
insect_leslie <- matrix(c(0, 0, 600, 0.2, 0, 0, 0, 0.08, 0),
                        nrow = 3, ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE)

```

```{r}
#Initial condition
insect_year0 <- c(12000, 700, 500)

```

```{r}
insect_y1 <- insect_leslie %*% insect_year0

```

Estimate populations at each life stage at year 2 and 3

```{r}
# estimate populations at year 2

insect_year2 <- insect_leslie %*% insect_y1
```

```{r}
insect_y3 <- insect_leslie %*% insect_year2
```
